# Product-Detail-Extraction

I have made an automation script using Puppeteer and Nodejs.

This project helps to fetch all the useful information of a Searched Product 

The websites used for fetching information are: snapdeal.com and flipkart.com

<ul>
  <i>
<li>Script will open the desired website - snapdeal and flipkart one by one.</li>
<li>Search for the product given as input by the user.</li>
<li>Get the url of the current page. </li>
<li>Fetch the details of the product - its price , brand , color and rating.</li>
  </i>
</ul>

To run the software: Use the following commands:-
npm install -----> this command will help to install project dependencies.

After all the modules get installed then run the price.js file using the following command:

>> <b>node price.js 'user search input'</b>

# Product-Detail-Extraction

I have made an automation script using Puppeteer and Nodejs.

This project helps to fetch all the useful information of a Searched Product 

The websites used for fetching information are: amazon.in and flipkart.com

<ul>
  <i>
<li>This project will extract the details of searched products from the Amazon.in and Flipkart.com.</li>
<li>Fetch the details of product as its price , brand , color and rating.</li>
<li>Automation used for visualisation of theh scraped websites.</li>
  </i>
</ul>

To run the software: Use the following commands:-
npm install -----> this command will help to install project dependencies.

After all the modules get installed then run the price.js file using the following command:

>> <b>node index.js</b>
